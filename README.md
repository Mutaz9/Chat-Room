Assumptions: User will not click cancel, enter in a previously made username, or a blank username. CSS file was not working (with TA assistance), put a link to the file and put the file in the html.

Creative Portion: 

1. We created leave room buttons that take the user out of the room
2. We created delete room buttons that remove the room
3. We added chat logs so when someone joins late they can see the previous messages
4. We added an unban feature
5. Listed current room and current username
